    explanation:
      "The main ingredient used in making traditional Korean fermented pastes called 'jang' (such as doenjang, ganjang, gochujang) is soybeans.

Doenjang is made by fermenting meju with salt water, and ganjang (soy sauce) is the liquid that forms during this process. Gochujang is made by fermenting a mixture of meju powder, red pepper powder, glutinous rice, malt, etc. These jang varieties serve as basic seasonings in Korean cuisine, providing unique umami flavors developed through complex fermentation processes that have evolved over centuries.",

      "True. 'Daljip Burning,' performed on Jeongwol Daeboreum (the 15th day of the first lunar month), is an important seasonal custom accompanying moon viewing, and is a ritual in agricultural society for praying for a good harvest, village peace, and family happiness in the coming year. The daljip (moon house) is a tower-shaped structure made of pine branches, straw, etc., and burning it when the full moon rises embodies the meaning of Jeaekchobog - driving away misfortune (Jeaek) and inviting good fortune (Chobog). In addition to this, various seasonal customs are passed down for Jeongwol Daeboreum, such as eating ogokbap (five-grain rice) and dried vegetables, cracking bureom (nuts), and drinking ear-brightening alcohol. These cultural practices reflect traditional Korean ideas that sought harmonious coexistence between nature and humans.",

    explanation:
      "The soy sauce in Andong Jjimdak is used directly for cooking without undergoing a fermentation process, while the others all include fermented foods. The dongchimi broth in Pyongyang Naengmyeon develops its sourness from lactic acid bacteria fermentation of vegetables, and gochujang in Jeonju Bibimbap is made by fermenting meju (fermented soybean blocks) with red pepper powder, glutinous rice, etc. The red pepper seasoning in Chuncheon Dakgalbi uses fermented gochujang as its base. Korean regional cuisine has utilized various fermentation techniques according to each region's climate and ingredient characteristics, which has become an important element in enhancing the deep flavor and preservation of Korean food.",

    explanation:
      "The person in the image is Shin Saimdang, and 'Taegyo Singi,' which is often attributed to her, is a book about pregnancy and prenatal education. However, it has been revealed that it was actually written by the wife of Shin Saimdang's son, Yulgok Yi I. This book is evaluated as the first specialized book on prenatal education in the East, emphasizing the importance of physical and mental health management for pregnant women and fetal education. Written in the 16th century, it contains pioneering insights into the physical and emotional development of the fetus, which are recognized in modern medicine, and has had a profound influence on Korean childbirth culture. Shin Saimdang is known as an outstanding artist and educator, and her portrait is used on the 50,000 won banknote in Korea.",

    explanation:
      "Sinduri Coastal Sand Dune in Taean is a natural landform formed during the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era. Coastal sand dunes are landforms created by wind-transported sand deposited on the coast, and the formation process is still ongoing due to continuous weathering and deposition. In contrast, Ulsanbawi Rock in Seoraksan was formed by granite erosion from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era, Cheonwangbong Peak in Jirisan is a gneiss mountain created by orogenic movement in the Paleozoic era, and the limestone cave system in Gangwon-do was formed by underground water dissolution in Paleozoic limestone areas. The diverse landforms of Korea have acquired their current appearance through different geological eras and formation processes, allowing us to trace the geological history of the Korean Peninsula.",

    question:
      "Korea's semiconductor industry has higher global market share in memory semiconductors than in system semiconductors, which is one of the factors causing an imbalance in the industrial structure.",
    explanation:
      "True. Korea's semiconductor industry shows dominant market share in memory semiconductors such as DRAM and NAND flash, with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix accounting for about 70% of the global market. However, in system semiconductors such as CPUs, GPUs, and mobile APs, it lacks relative competitiveness compared to U.S. companies like Intel, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA. This biased industrial structure creates vulnerability where the national economy is greatly affected by memory semiconductor price fluctuations, and the Korean government and companies are focusing on expanding R&D investment in the system semiconductor field and fostering specialized talent to improve this. Balanced development of the semiconductor industry is recognized as an important task for the long-term growth and stability of the Korean economy.",
