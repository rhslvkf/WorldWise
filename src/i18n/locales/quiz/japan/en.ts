    explanation:
      "Preparing fugu (pufferfish) dishes in Japan requires a special license. Fugu contains lethal toxins (tetrodotoxin), so in Japan, chefs must undergo rigorous training and obtain a license to prepare and serve fugu. The chef must learn how to safely remove the toxic parts of the fish. Improperly prepared fugu can cause severe poisoning or death, leading to the saying 'with one bite, you taste heaven, with the next, you meet death.' About 50 tons of fugu are consumed annually in Japan, served in various ways including sashimi, fried, and in soup.",
