    options: ["Naan", "Paratha", "Roti", "Kulcha"],
    explanation:
      "The bread shown in the image is Naan, a leavened flatbread popular in Indian cuisine, particularly in North India. Traditionally, naan is made from a dough of white flour, yeast, yogurt, and sometimes milk, which gives it its characteristic soft and slightly chewy texture. It is typically cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) where it is slapped against the hot inner walls, causing it to puff up and develop a distinctive slightly charred, blistered surface. Naan can be served plain or with various flavorings such as garlic (garlic naan), butter (butter naan), or stuffed with ingredients like minced meat (keema naan). It is commonly eaten with curries, dal (lentil dishes), and other main courses in Indian cuisine.",

    explanation:
      "The traditional way of eating food in India is using the right hand. In Indian culture, the left hand is traditionally considered unclean as it is used for hygienic purposes, so food is handled with the right hand. When eating with hands, the fingers are typically brought together to scoop up food, and the thumb is used to push the food into the mouth. Different regions may have slight variations in technique. This practice is common across India, especially for traditional meals served on banana leaves or metal thalis (plates with various compartments). While many urban Indians and restaurants now offer cutlery, eating with the hand remains common in homes and traditional eateries as it is believed to enhance the sensory experience of eating.",

    explanation:
      "True. India does have one of the highest percentages of vegetarians in the world. Approximately 20-40% of India's population practices vegetarianism, which is significantly higher than most other countries. This dietary preference is influenced by religious traditions such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, which emphasize non-violence (ahimsa) toward animals. Many Hindus who do eat meat still avoid beef, as cows are considered sacred. The concept of vegetarianism in India goes beyond just the absence of meat; it includes detailed classifications such as 'pure vegetarian' (excluding eggs) and 'sattvic' diets (excluding onions and garlic). Due to this large vegetarian population, India has developed one of the world's most diverse and sophisticated vegetarian cuisines.",

    explanation:
      "True. Masala chai (spiced tea) did originate in India but became more widespread during the British colonial period. Tea itself was not commonly consumed in India until the British established tea plantations in regions like Assam in the 19th century to break China's monopoly on tea production. While Indians had long been using spices for medicinal beverage preparations, the addition of these spices to black tea gained popularity during the British Raj. The British East India Company promoted tea consumption, but many Indians adapted the plain black tea by adding milk, sugar, and spices to suit local tastes. Over time, this spiced milk tea became ingrained in Indian culture, with chai vendors (chai wallahs) becoming a common sight throughout the country. Today, masala chai is an integral part of daily life in India and has gained international popularity as 'chai tea' or 'chai latte.'",

He independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations), many of which were completely novel. In 1913, he began a correspondence with the British mathematician G.H. Hardy, which led to him being invited to Cambridge University. Tragically, Ramanujan died at the young age of 32 due to illness, cutting short what could have been an even more remarkable career.

  "quiz.in.states": {
    question: "How many states does the Indian federation consist of?",
    options: ["22", "25", "28", "31"],
    explanation:
      "The Indian federation consists of 28 states and 8 union territories. Each state has its own elected government and legislature, with significant autonomy in areas such as education, agriculture, police, and public health. Union territories, on the other hand, are smaller administrative units that are directly governed by the central government, though some have been granted partial statehood with their own elected legislatures. The states of India were largely reorganized along linguistic lines in the 1950s and 1960s, though subsequent state formations have considered various factors including cultural, ethnic, and geographical considerations. The most recent major reorganization occurred in 2019 when the state of Jammu and Kashmir was reconstituted into two union territories: Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.",

The building features a circular perimeter and a central dome under which the Central Hall is located. This Central Hall is used for joint sessions of Parliament and was also where India's Constitution was drafted and where the transfer of power from British rule to independent India took place at midnight on August 14-15, 1947. Sansad Bhavan is part of the larger Lutyens' Delhi area, which includes many other important government buildings designed in a distinctive Indo-British architectural style.",

    question: "What is the most important crop in Indian agriculture?",
    options: ["Rice", "Wheat", "Corn", "Cotton"],
    explanation:
      "Rice is one of the most important crops in Indian agriculture. India is the world's second-largest producer of rice after China, with rice cultivation spanning across various regions, particularly in eastern and southern India. Rice is a staple food for a majority of India's population, especially in eastern, southern, and northeastern regions. It holds cultural and religious significance, being used in various ceremonies and rituals. Agriculture is a critical sector of the Indian economy, contributing about 17-18% of the country's GDP and employing nearly half of the workforce. Besides rice, other important crops include wheat (grown mainly in the northern plains), pulses, sugarcane, cotton, jute, tea, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. The monsoon rains play a crucial role in Indian agriculture, with a significant portion of agricultural land dependent on rainfall rather than irrigation.",

    question: "Which political party has held power for the longest period in India since independence?",
    options: [
      "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)",
      "Indian National Congress",
      "Communist Party of India",
      "Bahujan Samaj Party",
    ],
    explanation:
      "The Indian National Congress (often simply called 'Congress') has held power for the longest period in India since independence. Founded in 1885, it was the primary political organization leading India's struggle for independence from British rule. After independence in 1947, Congress dominated Indian politics for decades, governing almost continuously from 1947 until 1989, with only brief interruptions. Several Prime Ministers from the Nehru-Gandhi family (Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi) led Congress governments during this period. However, since the 1990s, India's political landscape has become more diverse with the rise of regional parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since 2014, the BJP, led by Narendra Modi, has been in power, marking a significant shift in Indian politics. Nevertheless, historically, the Congress party has held power for the longest cumulative period since India's independence.",

    question: "India was one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.",
    explanation:
      "True. India was indeed one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The Non-Aligned Movement was established in 1961 at the Belgrade Conference, as an organization of states that did not formally align with either the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, along with Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito, Indonesia's Sukarno, and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, were the five principal founders of this movement. Nehru's policy of non-alignment became a cornerstone of India's foreign policy after independence, reflecting the country's desire to maintain strategic autonomy in international affairs. This policy was informed by Nehru's 'Panchsheel' (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence), which advocated mutual respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.",
