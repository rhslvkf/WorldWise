Cantonese-style mooncakes typically have sweet fillings like lotus seed paste or red bean paste, Suzhou-style ones often have savory pork fillings, and Yunnan-style may include ham and flowers. Mooncakes are eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival (15th day of the 8th lunar month) to celebrate family unity and prosperity. Their round shape symbolizes the full moon and family reunion.

    question: "China's Reform and Opening-up policy began during the era of Mao Zedong.",
    explanation:
      "False. China's Reform and Opening-up policy began not during Mao Zedong's era but during Deng Xiaoping's leadership in 1978. Mao died in 1976, and during his era, China pursued a planned economy and self-reliance policies. Deng Xiaoping, after gaining power following Mao's death, formally initiated the Reform and Opening-up policy at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 1978. This policy included agricultural reforms, state-owned enterprise reforms, introduction of market economy elements, attraction of foreign investment, and establishment of Special Economic Zones, which laid the foundation for China's rapid economic growth and modernization. Deng's pragmatic approach is symbolized by his famous saying: 'It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.'",

    question:
      "In which cities are mainland China's major stock exchanges located (excluding Hong Kong Stock Exchange)?",
    options: ["Shanghai and Guangzhou", "Beijing and Chengdu", "Chongqing and Nanjing", "Shanghai and Shenzhen"],
    explanation:
      "Mainland China's major stock exchanges are located in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The Shanghai Stock Exchange, established in 1990, primarily lists large state-owned enterprises and blue-chip stocks. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange, also established in 1990, has more small and medium-sized enterprises and technology companies listed, sometimes called 'China's Nasdaq.' The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, though part of China as a Special Administrative Region, operates under a separate financial system as an international financial center with a different regulatory framework. China has recently expanded the opening of its capital markets through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect programs.",

  "quiz.cn.population_policy": {
    question: "What population policy did China implement from 1979 to 2015?",
    options: ["Two-Child Policy", "One-Child Policy", "Three-Child Policy", "Birth Encouragement Policy"],
    explanation:
      "China implemented the One-Child Policy from 1979 to 2015. This policy restricted urban Han Chinese couples to having only one child (with some exceptions for ethnic minorities and rural areas) to control population growth. While it significantly reduced China's population growth rate, it also led to unintended consequences like gender imbalance (preference for boys), accelerated aging, and the 'little emperor' phenomenon (only children being overly pampered). In 2016, China switched to a Two-Child Policy, and in 2021, introduced a Three-Child Policy in response to declining birth rates. China has thus been adjusting its policies according to changes in demographic structure and has recently shifted toward encouraging births.",
